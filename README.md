# binary-tree
This project is dedicated to the development of a binary tree and its implementation using the Python language.

We implement the following operations to manage the binary tree:
  - insert the unit according to the brand of the device;
  - output of all nodes with a measurement limit not lower than specified;
  - removal of all nodes with a given year of issue;
  - bypassing the tree "from top to bottom".

To implement the tree, use the Device class. Which will have the following fields:
  - type of device (voltmeter, etc.);
  - brand of the device (B-16A, etc.);
  - measurement limit;
  - graduation year.
